  wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.1.3/terraform_1.1.3_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_1.1.3_linux_amd64.zip
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
```
  #### 2. Configure Terraform for Azure:
  ```hcl
  provider "azurerm" {
    features{}
  }
```
### Defining Resources (Networking, Storage, VMs, etc.)
  #### 1. Networking
  ```hcl
  resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "main" {
    name                 = "mainVNET"
    address_space        = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
    location             = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
    resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  }

  resource "azurerm_subnet" "subnet1" {
    name                 = "subnet1"
    resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
    virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.main.name
    address_prefixes     = ["10.0.1.0/24"]
  }
  ```
  #### 2. Storage:

## 6. Migration Implementation
### Data Migration
    1. Database Migration: Use Azure Database Migration Service to migrate databases
    2. File Transfer: Use AzCopy or Azure Data Factory for transferring files and data
### Application Migration
    1. Lift and Shift: Move applications to Azure VMs
    2. Re-architecture: Re-design applications for Azure App Services or other PaaS offerings
### Network Configuration
    1. VPN Setup: Configure site-to-sire VPN or ExpressRoute
    2. DNS Configuration: Update DNS settings for Azure
### Security Configuration
    1. Implement Firewalls and NSGs: Protect the network
    2. Enable Azure Security Center: Continuous security monitoring
### Conversations and Decisions
  - Q: Should we lift and shift or re-architect applications?
    - A: For critical applications needing minimal downtime, lift and shift is preferrd       
      initially. Re-architect non-critical applications for better scalability and cost     
      efficiency
  - Q: How de we handle data transfer without downtime?
    - A: Use Azure Database Migration Service for live database migration and AzCopy for     
      incremental data transfer.
