## 1. Requirements Gathering
### Case Study: XYZ Corporation's Current Infrastructure

  - Servers: 50 physical servers running various applications and services.
  - Storage: 100 TB of data stored across SAN and NAS devices.
  - Network: Complex network topology with firewalls, load balancers, and VLANs.
  - Applications: Mix of web applications, databases, and custom software.
  - Users: 500 employees and external users accessing services.

### Initial Meetings and Conversations

  - Objective: Understand the current setup, identify critical applications, and define migration success criteria.
  - Participants: IT Manager, Network Administrator, Database Administrator, Application Owners.

### Questions and Answers

  - Q: What are the key business applications currently running on-premises?
    - A: We have ERP, CRM, and custom web applications critical to business operations.
  - Q: Are there any compliance requirements we need to be aware of?
    - A: Yes, we need to comply with GDPR and HIPAA regulations.
  - Q: What are your performance and availability requirements?
    - A: The ERP system needs high availability with 99.9% uptime, and the CRM system requires low latency.
  - Q: Are there any existing issues with the current infrastructure?
    - A: We face frequent storage bottlenecks and network latency issues.

## 3. Planning and Design

### High-Level Design
  - Architecture: Design a robust and scalable Azure architecture.
Components: Networking, storage, VMs, identity, security, and governance.
Detailed Architecture Diagrams

Network Diagram: VNETs, subnets, NSGs, VPN gateways.
Storage Diagram: Storage accounts, blobs, and file shares.
VM Configuration: Sizes, OS, disks, and availability sets.
Security Diagram: Firewalls, NSGs, ASGs, and Azure Security Center.
Risk Management

Risks: Data loss, downtime, security breaches.
Mitigations: Regular backups, phased migration, rigorous testing.
Conversations and Decisions

Q: How should we segment our VNETs?
A: Based on application tiers (web, app, DB) and security requirements.
Q: What storage solutions should we use?
A: Use Azure Blob Storage for unstructured data and Azure Files for shared file storage.
Q: How do we ensure secure access to Azure resources?
A: Implement Azure AD for identity management and RBAC for access control.
