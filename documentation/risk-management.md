Identify, assess, and manage risks throughout the project lifecycle.

## Risk Assessment
| Risk                       | Impact  | Probability | Mitigation Strategy                      |
|----------------------------|---------|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| Data Loss                  | High    | Low         | Regular backups and verification         |
| Downtime during migration  | Medium  | Medium      | Schedule migration during off-peak hours |
| Security Breach            | High    | Low         | Implement robust security measures       |
| Cost Overruns              | Medium  | High        | Monitor budget regularly                 |

## Contingency Plan
- **Data Loss**: Restore from backups
- **Downtime**: Rollback to previous state
- **Security Breach**: Immediate incident response and mitigation
- **Cost Overruns**: Re-evaluate and adjust project scope
