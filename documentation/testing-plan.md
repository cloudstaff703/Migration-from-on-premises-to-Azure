# Testing Plan 

## Objectives
Ensure that all components function correctly after migration.

## types of testing
1. **Unit Testing**:
    - Test individual components.
2. **Integration Testing**:
    - Test interactions between components.
3. **Performance Testing**:
    - Test system performance under load.
4. **Security Testing**:
    - Test for potential vulnerabilities.

## Test Cases
| Test Case ID | Description                                    | Expected Result                          |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| TC01         | Validate VM connectivity                       | Successful SSH/RDP connection            |
| TC02         | Check database integrity post-migration        | Data consistency and integrity verified  |
| TC03         | Verify application deployment on Azure         | Application runs without errors          |
| TC04         | Perform load testing on the application        | Application handles load without issues  |
| TC05         | Conduct security assessment of the environment | No critical vulnerabilities found        |

## Test Plan
1. **Preparation**:
    - Define test environment and tools.
    - Create test data and scenarios.
2. **Execution**:
    - Perform tests as pwe the test cases.
    - Record results and document any issues.
3. **Review**:
    - Analyze test results.
    - Identify and prioritize issues.
4. **Remediation**:
    - Fix identified issues.
    - Retest to ensure issues are resolved.
